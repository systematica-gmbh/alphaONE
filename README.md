alpha:ONE
=========

alpha:ONE is an industrial multipurpose 32bit microcontroller board, which might be programmed as well with MicroPython for rapid prototyping as with C for products.
Here we lean on MicroPython. We publish MicroPython that is ported to alpha:ONE and libraries that simplify the control of actuators or the reading of sensors.
